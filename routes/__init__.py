"""Blueprint registration and ordering for Rules Central application.

This module defines the registration order for all application blueprints.
The order is important because Flask uses first-match routing, so more specific
routes should be registered before catch-all routes.

The main export is `ALL_BLUEPRINTS` which should be used by the application factory.
